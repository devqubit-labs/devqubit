Added ``--since``/``--until`` time-range filtering to ``devqubit list``, ``devqubit doctor`` command for stale run recovery, and full ``RegistryProtocol`` alignment for remote, S3, and GCS backends (context managers, connection lifecycle, time-range queries).

The runs table now shows a live-ticking Duration column for running experiments. New runs and status changes appear automatically without page refresh.
