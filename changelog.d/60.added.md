Added metric time-series tracking with automatic background persistence and live SVG charts on the run detail page. Metrics logged with `step` are batch-inserted into a dedicated `metric_points` table every 10 seconds, keeping memory and I/O constant regardless of run length. All storage backends (local, S3, GCS, remote) support the new read/write API.
