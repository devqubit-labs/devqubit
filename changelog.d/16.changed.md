UEC ExecutionEnvelope is now the single source of truth for diffs/verification: adapter runs must emit a schema-valid envelope; “non-strict” fallback/synthesis for adapter runs was removed. Manual/replay runs still synthesize a best-effort envelope. Program comparison now distinguishes structural vs parametric hashes and results are canonicalized across bit orders.
